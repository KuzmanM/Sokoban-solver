# Sokoban-solver
Simple brute force tool, solving Sokoban puzzles.
Not applicable to boards with many boxes because of progressive branching of the possible moves. Usually solves puzzles with up to 4 boxes, but not always.
Performance could be improvet with extension of FilterBoardConditions and FilterMovements methods - will reduce branches of the tree.
